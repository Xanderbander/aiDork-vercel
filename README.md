# aiDork - Automated Payment Card Verification WebApp

This project is an autonomous web application called aiDork that uses pre-defined dork queries to search for recently mentioned payment card data. The app then verifies the data for structured card information using regex patterns in a hacker-themed UI.  

Features of aiDork: 
- Automated queries to separate revent payment card data with fields like CVV, expiration date, cardholder name, and zip code.
- Flags and regulizary filtering layers to remove irrelevant mentions.
- Dark user interface with blood-red accents, highlights, and hover animations.
